        I'm writing to let you know that your exchange application is currently being processed by the International Admissions Office.  They have indicated that admission documents should be ready by the end of this week.  I will upload your Notice of Admission and DS-2019 to the Documents section of your application as soon as I receive them.  These are your official documents that you will use to get your J-1 visa.  An original DS-2019 is no longer required to obtain a visa.

        Once you receive your admission documents, you will be able to claim your NetID and password, set up your Illinois email account, and apply for University Housing.  Note:  If you submit an application for University Housing, you are entering a contract with University Housing and withdrawing or cancelling your University Housing contract results in a fee that is almost the full cost of housing for the semester.

        You need to arrive to campus by Monday, January 8th to participate in the mandatory orientation on January 10th.  Classes begin on Tuesday, January 16th.
