# Enrollment

1. You cannot add a class that has a time conflict with a class in which you are
   already successfully enrolled. However, you are allowed to do so if the class
   only conflicts with a class for which you are on the waitlist. It is
   important to note that this may lead to undesired outcomes.

    For example,
    let's say you prefer course A over B, but they have a scheduling
    conflict. You added yourself to the waitlist for course A first and later
    successfully enrolled in course B. However, enrolling in course B prevents
    you from enrolling in course A. Additionally, there is a possibility that
    other students on the waitlist may secure a spot ahead of you.
