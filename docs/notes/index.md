## Enrollment

1. You cannot add a class that has a time conflict with some class you have
   sucessfully enrolled in. However, you can do this if the class only conflicts
   with some class for which you are on the waitlist. This may cause
   unwanted result. 
    - E.g., you prefer course A over B and they conflict. You first added A and
      were on the waitlist for A. Later you added B and sucessfully enrolled in
      it. Then B prevents you from enrolling in A. Furthermore, other students
      on the waitlist may jump in ahead of you.
